# GifTastic

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize the GIPHY API, JavaScript, and jQuery to display a variety of Gifs within a topic to the webpage.

### How to utilize the webpage
The user can click on any of the buttons across the top of the screen that display names of TV Shows within them. 

Once clicked, ten gifs will appear on the screen, along with the ratings for each gif.

When another button is clicked, ten new gifs will appear relative to the TV show displayed on the button.

The user can use the "Add a Show" form to add a show of their choosing to the array of buttons. 

Once added, the user can then click their newly created button to display ten gifs and ratings related to that TV show.

### Why GifTastic?
This project is a great way to discover how APIs work and how to manipulate HTML using JavaScript and jQuery. 

The API key used for this project was created using the website https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true.
